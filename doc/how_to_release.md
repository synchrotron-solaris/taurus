# How to release

This is a guide for taurus release managers: it details the
steps for making an official release, including a checklist
of stuff that should be manually tested.

## The release process

1. During all the development, use the Milestones to keep track of the intended release for each issue
2. Previous to the release deadline, re-check the open issues/PR and update the assignation issues/PR to the release milestone. Request feedback from the devel community.
3. Work to close all the PR/issues remaining open in the milestone. This can be either done in develop or in a release branch called `release-XXX` (where `XXX` is the milestone name, e.g. `Jul17`). If a release branch is used, `develop` is freed to continue with integrations that may not be suitable for this release. On the other hand, it adds a bit more work  because the release-related PRs (which are done against the `release-XXX` branch), may need to be also merged to develop. Note: the `release-XXX` branch *can* live in the taurus-org repo or on a personal fork (in which case you should do step 4.iv **now** to allow other integrators to push directly to it).
4. Create the release branch if it was not done already in the previous step and:
    1. Review and update the CHANGELOG.md if necessary. See [this](http://keepachangelog.com)
    2. Bump version using `bumpversion <major|minor|patch>`  (use [semver](http://semver.org/) criteria to choose amongst `major`, `minor` or `patch`
    3. Create a PR to merge the `release-XXX` against the **`master`** branch of the taurus-org repo
5. Request reviews in the PR from at least one integrator from each participating institute. The master branch is protected, so the reviews need to be cleared (or dismissed with an explanation) before the release can be merged.
6. Perform manual tests (see checklist below). You may use the CI artifacts (e.g., from appveyor). To avoid spamming the PR comments with the manual test results, a new issue can be created to report the tests results on each platform (and just use a single check for each platform in the PR).
7. Once all reviews a cleared, update the date of the release in the CHANGELOG.md, run `bumpversion release`, push and merge the PR and tag in master
8. Check that travis-ci correctly uploaded to PyPI (triggered on tag push).

   Previously:
   ~~Release to PyPI **from a clean checkout** and using [twine](https://github.com/pypa/twine):~~
   > ```
   > cd /tmp
   > git clone https://github.com/taurus-org/taurus.git -b <RELEASE_TAG>
   > cd taurus
   > python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   >twine upload dist/*
   > ```
  
9. Merge also the  `release-XXX` branch into develop, and bump the version of develop with `bumpversion patch`
10. Complete GitHub release (upload artifacts, edit text)
11. Create news in www.tango-controls.org
    1. On the News page click on Submit a news and fill up the form (if it doesn't work, try opening in new tab):
       * Title: New Release Of Taurus X.X.X (Jan|JulXX)
       * Ilustration: Taurus official logo (use png)
       * Summary: short summary of the news (do not include the whole changelog here..)
       * Categories: Release
    2. After submitting click on Modify this content text of the area \<\<Content\>\> and provide detailes of the release e.g. changelog.
12. Notify mailing lists (taurus-users@lists.sourceforge.net, taurus-devel@lists.sourceforge.net, info@tango-controls.org)



## Manual test checklist

This is a check-list of manual tests. It is just orientative. Expand it at will.
This list assumes a clean environment with all Taurus dependencies already installed
and access to a Tango system with the TangoTest DS running.

Hint: this list can be used as a template to be copy-pasted on an issue linked from the release PR
```
### Installation

For tips on how to prepare an environment for installation, see 
http://taurus-scada.org/users/getting_started.html


- [ ] Install Taurus from the an artifact of Appveyor (tgz or msi): `pip install <tarball_artifact_URL>`
- [ ] Install taurus-pyqtgraph from the master branch of its repo: 
      `pip install https://github.com/taurus-org/taurus_pyqtgraph/archive/master.zip`.
- [ ] Check installed version of taurus: `taurus --version`
- [ ] Check installed version of taurus_pyqtgraph: `taurus tpg --version`

### taurus demo

- [ ] Execute `taurus demo`
- [ ] Test all of the buttons of the taurus demo. All demos should launch correctly and without raising exceptions
- [ ] For TaurusLabel, check foreground role, the background role, the prefix, the suffix, the formatter, etc.
- [ ] For TaurusLabel, in order to test the background role=value, you can use the following attribute: `eval:["FAULT","ON","OFF","ALARM"][randint(4)]`
- [ ] For TaurusLabel, use a model with fragment (e.g., `sys/tg_test/1/ampli#rvalue.magnitude`, `eval:Q('1mm')#rvalue.units`, `eval:10*arange(9)#rvalue[3:4]`)
- [ ] For LCD: Test the foreground roles and the background role
- [ ] For Led: Test the colors, ON color, Off color. (hint: you can use `eval:False` as a model for testing)

### taurus guiqwt image

- [ ] Execute `taurus guiqwt image --demo`
- [ ] try to resize the image and pan it using the mouse.
- [ ] check the cross section tools, the color maps, etc.
- [ ] replace the image using the "Change Taurus Model" button (choose , eg, sys/tg_test/1/double_image_ro)

### taurus guiqwt trend2d

- [ ] Execute: `taurus --polling-period 333 guiqwt trend2d --demo`
- [ ] Execute: `taurus --polling-period 333 guiqwt trend2d -xt --demo`  **(known to fail in 4.1.0)**
- [ ] Execute: `taurus --polling-period 333 guiqwt trend2d -xe --demo`
- [ ] Test auto-scroll and auto-scale tools (from context menu)

### taurus designer
- [ ] Execute `taurus designer`. Check that the taurus widgets are present in the catalog
- [ ] Create an empty widget and drag various taurus widgets to it (they should be correctly dropped)

### taurus device
- [ ] Execute: `taurus device sys/tg_test/1`
- [ ] Check that it opens correctly and that the attrs and commands are populated
- [ ] Execute SwitchStates command (see that the state label changes to FAULT and its color to red)
      and then execute the Init command and the label returns to RUNNING (blue)
      
### taurus panel
- [ ] Execute: `taurus panel`
- [ ] Navigate in the tree and select the TangoTest device (the attr an command panels should be populated)
- [ ] Execute SwitchStates command to put it in FAULT, close the GUI and reopen it. Repeat previous point again.

### taurus form
(basically try all features described in the [user's guide](http://taurus-scada.org/users/ui/index.html)

- [ ] Launch `taurus form sys/tg_test/1/short_scalar`
- [ ] go to label context menu, change the configuration and set range to (-1000, 1000), alarm to (-500, 500) and unit to `mm`. Close the form and relaunch. The new units should be used. Change the the write value and check that the orange color is used when in warning values, and that the write widget does not allow to write values out of range.
- [ ] Test to drag and drop of this attribute onto the same form many times (4 times)
      (If it crashes, you are seeing bug #96)
- [ ] Open "Modify Contents" and add sys/tg_test/1 and all of its attributes. They should all show ok
- [ ] Test the compact mode  (switch to compact, noncompact; edit when in compact mode, ...) for a single
      value (from the context menu of a value label)
- [ ] Test compact mode for all values (from the context menu of the whole form)
- [ ] Test changing labels
- [ ] Test changing the formatter for a single value (from the context menu of a value label) (use, e.g. `>>{}<<`). Do this in compact and non compact modes.
- [ ] Test changing the formatter for all values (from the context menu of the whole form)
- [ ] Test re-order of values with "Modify contents"
- [ ] Test the different "show" buttons (tables, images, spectra)
- [ ] Change the write widget of double_scalar by a TaurusWheelEdit
- [ ] Change other read and write widgets
- [ ] After the previous changes, you should have a quite "custom" form. Use "Save current Settings" and save 
      to "tf.pck". Close the form and reopen it with `taurus form --config tf.pck`
